description: Turn a game idea or source into a playable GoDesk Shared Session and return its invitation URL. Use when a creator asks to make, prototype, generate, share, or quickly test a rule-orchestrated game with friends.

# Create a Shareable Prototype

The only create path. `$create-game-project` delegates here.

The success path is Idea or Source → playable finished game → invitation URL
that others can open and play. Presentation Floor and Playability Floor,
immutable Build, Studio embedded Shared Session, and a stable Playtest Link
exist to make that output real. A themed score-race stand-in is not delivery.
A Finding is optional.

## Kernel selection

Use the **Executable Kernel choice** table in `$godesk-plugin-basics` as the
single source of truth. Configure exactly one Kernel that matches the source
genre (`hidden-role-v1`, `hand-play-v1`, `conversation-relay-v1`, and the rest
of that table). Do not substitute `score-race-v1` for another genre. Weak genre near-misses must refuse silent score-race share (draft or Floor fail).

Turn-limit / termination reminders (also owned by that table's semantics):

- Scoring, shared-goal, and turn-taking Kernels require a turn limit.
- Take-away and draw-and-score terminate from finite resources.
- Give roll-and-move a visible safety turn limit with no invented winner.
- Give push-your-luck a visible action safety limit with no invented winner.
- Keep unsupported source behavior visible. Do not convert a cooperative goal
  into a competitive score race merely because both actions carry numbers.

## Workflow

1. Call `create_project` once and immediately open its returned Web Studio URL.
   Submit and track `generate-rule-system` with the idea and optional source
   content. Classify every supplied image before submission: `visual-reference`
   when it only guides style or composition, `project-asset` when the creator
   wants the exact pixels in the game. Include harvested page images as
   `project-asset` entries in `visualInputs` when a PDF is supplied. Make
   conservative defaults for working name, participant range, and duration
   when those details are non-blocking, and state them.
2. Read `generation-plan`, Sources, and the Rule System. Review the plan's
   loop, actions, assumptions, and unsupported behavior. If its runtime support
   is still `draft`, use one version-checked `apply_project_patch` to make the
   requested game explicit: update the Rule System fields and configure the
   Kernel from the table above. Mark Codex-proposed rules as `ai-proposed`,
   keep every unsupported behavior visible, and disclose the assumptions in
   the handoff. Then approve the pending plan with `approve_generation_plan`
   using the latest project version. Compile only an approved, executable
   Rule System.
3. Harvest and bind extracted art first. Use
   `generate-visual-fill` for missing art; without host generation capacity,
   apply typographic/programmatic presentation or a theme kit so the
   Presentation Floor supports the selected play surface. A kit alone is not
   enough for conversation / cards / placement: friends must also see transcript,
   hand/play areas, or named regions ("桌子好看但还不是那款游戏"). Harbor /
   `港口十三号` aims at the settlecoast **2D presentation bar** on the invite
   URL (labeled cargo tracks + dock groups) — not a 3D / GameFactory port.
4. Submit `compile-build` with the latest version and track it to terminal.
   Inspect warnings, unsupported behavior, `presentationFloor`, and
   `playabilityFloor`. Playability Floor also requires **decision density**
   (non-empty hands; worker-placement `regions.length ≥ 2` with capacity;
   conversation speech actions; hidden-role roles + accuse path) — kernel
   type alone is not enough. If either floor is unmet, fix the gap and
   compile again; do not create a Shared Session.
5. If the creator named a question to test, persist it as a Design Hypothesis
   before sharing. Call `create_shared_session` with the immutable Build ID,
   explicit seed, stable idempotency key, and that exact `hypothesisId`.
   Otherwise create an explicitly exploratory Session without a hypothesis.
   Re-read the Session and verify its Experiment Brief. Open Web Studio and use
   the embedded Room for one Creator self-play action; verify the Accepted
   Action in the same Session State and Replay before sharing.
6. Create a fresh Shared Session for friends. Re-read the latest project version,
   apply `publish_shared_session` with that Room ID, then read the
   `playtest-link` view. Open the stable URL and verify it resolves to the
   selected Room. Publishing a later Room moves only the stable pointer; it
   leaves old Room URLs, Replays, feedback, and already-open sessions unchanged.
7. Tell friends they can claim a seat, play in the browser, and leave a rating
   plus short comment from that same URL. Each browser/client must claim exactly
   one seat before its first Intent; re-read the Shared Session to confirm the
   action and feedback were persisted before using them as design observations.
   When an Experiment Brief exists, the friend should answer its visible
   question; use that Session only with the same Design Hypothesis in a Finding.
8. Return the stable Playtest Link first and state that friends only need this
   browser link. Include the selected immutable Shared Session URL, Build URL,
   provenance, warnings,
   unsupported behavior, feedback count, and the Web Studio URL containing the
   Studio embedded self-play surface as secondary verification links.

Participant feedback is accepted only after that seat completes an action.
When reading it back, verify its Feedback Moment names the expected
`actionSequence` and `actionId` before using the exact snapshot in a Finding.

The Playtest Link is the complete friend handoff; do not give friends plugin
installation steps.
